Wow, happy to come to this final task and make reflections.
It was an amazing experience for me in git and github. So many difficuilities I have met in last week, from downloading to pushing. And for sure, pushing is the complex part for me. At first I signed in with ZJUserver and found it difficult to finishing pushing successfully. But having heard that someone had successfully pushed in this way, I just didn't want to give it up. But as trying and failing so many times for four days, on Saturday evening, just today I decided to try the new way given by professioner. Yes it actually work and you can't imagine how happy I am now! During this time, I experiecce one spirit, stick on and don' give up!
Moreover in this wonderful experience, I have developed the ability to learn and explore new things by myself! Searching the internet, asking friends and teachers for help both gave me a lot!
In my own GitHub repository,I say a lot in Smiling. And I hope and be confident to explore computer deeper, smiling! Easy to find that now I hold great interest in computer science! Fullfilling and interesting experience for me!
